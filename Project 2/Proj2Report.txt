Project 2 Report
1. Ray Tracing Results
Lambertian Shading
 

Phong Shading
 



2. Approach for Special Effect
	For this project I attempted to implement shadows as a special effect. My approach for this was once an intersection was detected, I constructed a ray with its origin at the surface of the object and its direction pointing towards a light source. I then passed that ray into my intersection function and if it returned a hit that meant that the ray intersected an object between the surface and the light source, so that point on the surface should be in shadow. 

3. Difficulties
	The largest difficulty that I encountered cam from calculating intersections for triangles. I also encountered difficulties getting shadows to work. 

4. Instruction for compiliation
Run make in src/mainsrc
./prog2_raytracer n
where n=1 for lambertian and n=2 for phong
