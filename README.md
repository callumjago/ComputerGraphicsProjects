# ComputerGraphicsProjects 
This repository contains the projects I worked on while taking CAP4730: Computer Graphics.

#### Over the course of this class, I worked on 4 projects and 1 final project.

### Project 1: Mesh Generation
- Setup a basic openGL project
- Generate a unit sphere mesh that can be subdivided to increase quality of approximation

### Project 2: Raytracing
- Create a program that can render simple shapes using a raytracing algorithm

### Project 3: Scene Manipulation
- Provide matrix operations for the translation/rotation/scaling of 3D objects

### Project 4: GLSL Programming
- Write GLSL code for reflectance mapping
